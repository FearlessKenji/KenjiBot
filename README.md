# Twitch Discord Bot
This Discord bot will automatically send a message and tag the assigned role whenever a streamer went live.
It also has functionality for posting new Reddit posts from subreddits of your choosing.
The notifications will update every minute(default) while the streamer is live.

## How does it work?
This Discord bot uses [The Official Twitch Api](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/) and [The Official Kick Api](https://docs.kick.com/). You are able to assign unlimited streamers to the bot. The bot uses the api to fetch the channel data in batches per server to limit api calls to see if the streamers specified by that server are live. If the streamer is live it will send a message in the assigned channel and it will also tag the assigned role. You will be able to choose the update time in the config file using crons. If the streamer is still live the bot will update the message after X amount of time.


## Installation
First you will have to clone the project.
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/FearlessKenji/KenjiB0t
```

## Dependencies
After installing, in order for the bot to work properly you will have to install the required node packages outlined in packages.json. Use the following command to install the dependencies.
```console
$ npm install
```

## Edit blank_config.json
- Rename to config.json
- token - Enter your [Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) here.
- twitchClientId - Enter the Twitch application client ID generated here: ([Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)).
- twitchSecret - Enter the Secret token generated on the Twitch application page. Do not share this.
- kickClientId - Enter the Kick application client ID here: ([Kick Developer Console](https://kick.com/settings/developer))
- kickSecret - Enter the Secret token generated on the Kick application page. Do not share this.
- botOwner - Copy and paste your discord ID for top access commands.
- clientId - Copy and paste your application ID. You need this to register commands.
- guildId - Copy and paste your Discord server ID here. This is for private guild-access commands.
- twitchCron - Checks Twitch for specified live channels every minute by default.
- kickCron - Checks Kick for specified live channels every minute by default.
- statusCron - Changes bot status every 10 minutes by default. Can be modified in ready.js in the events folder.
- authCron - Updates Twitch and Kick auth tokens every hour by default. Generated tokens are stored in auth/tokens.json.

All of these fields are required.

Check [Cron Guru](https://crontab.guru/) for help setting up crons. Crons will always fire at a specific clock time regardless of startup time.

## Register Slash Commands
Before you can use the commands, you need to run 
```console
$ node deploy-global-commands.js
```
and/or
```console
$ node deploy-guild-commands.js
```

The global commands will be available in all servers. The guild commands will only be available in the server whos ID is matched with 'guildId' in the config.


## Run the bot
After you updated the config.json, installed the dependencies, and registered the commands, you can run the final command.
Use the command in the same directory as the index.js file.
```console
$ node index.js
```
or
```console
$ npm run start
```

Alternatively, there is an executable provided that will run the second command with additional parameters to make running it easier.

## Add streamers
Use the 'stream' slash command to add users to the database. Usage:
```console
/twitch add name: FearlessKenji discord: https://discord.gg/FearlessKenji
```
- name - Enter the streamer login name here. This name is the same as the name in the channel URL.  
Example:
  - URL = https://www.twitch.tv/fearlesskenji
  - name = fearlesskenji
- discord - This field is not required but if the Streamer has their own Discord server you could add the invite url here. 
- self - This field is not required. False by default. Set to true if this is your channel.
- twitch - This field is false by default. Set to true to get twitch notifications for this streamer.
- kick - This field is false by default. Set to true to get kick notifications for this streamer.

By default, if you simply add a username, nothing will happen. You must specify if you want twitch or kick notifications or both.

There should be feedback on whether or not the addition was successful.
There is a list command to check for spelling if updates are not coming through. This will also tell you if they are labeled as self and what kind of notifications are set.
There is also a remove command for that removes entries from the database. 

Congratulations! You have successfully setup the bot.
