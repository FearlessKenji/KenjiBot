# Hachi

Hachi is a Discord bot for Twitch and Kick live notifications. It can post when streamers go live, update live messages while streams continue, manage birthdays, create reaction-role panels, post rules embeds, and provide small utility commands.

Hachi is managed through `HachiGen.exe`, a windowed setup and runtime manager included in the project.

## What Hachi Does

- Twitch and Kick live notifications with configurable Discord channels and role pings
- Stream message updates while a streamer remains live
- VoD/end-of-stream updates when a previous live message can be matched
- Per-server notification setup for self streams and affiliate streams
- Birthday storage, birthday month lists, one-week reminders, birthday-day posts, and RecoCards card buttons
- Reaction-role panel creation, editing, message conversion, and cleanup when messages or channels are deleted
- Per-server profile customization with avatar, banner, bio, and nickname fields
- Rules embeds with optional reaction verification
- Timestamp and dice rolling utility commands

Hachi uses [The Official Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/) and [The Official Kick API](https://docs.kick.com/). Stream checks are batched per server to limit API calls.

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `HachiGen.exe`.
3. Confirm or choose the Hachi install path.
4. Open the Setup page and fill in Configuration.
5. Select Install / Validate.
6. Select Deploy Commands.
7. Select Start.

HachiGen handles setup, install validation, dependency checks, command deployment, updates, PM2 runtime control, and logs from its own window.

## Requirements

- Windows for `HachiGen.exe`
- A Discord application and bot token
- A Discord server for testing guild commands
- Twitch and Kick developer credentials for live-notification checks

## HachiGen

HachiGen is the desktop manager for Hachi. It is intentionally separate from the bot runtime so it can manage the install path, configuration, updates, command deployment, PM2 status, and logs without changing the bot's core process.

HachiGen can:

- Select and save the Hachi install path
- Install or validate the selected Hachi folder
- Install missing package dependencies during validation or bot start
- Save `.env` and `config/config.json` through the Configuration page
- Check for Git updates with one button that changes to Update when an update is available
- Back up `.env`, `config/config.json`, and `database/database.sqlite` before applying updates
- Save local file changes to a recoverable Git stash before updating
- Restore or delete HachiGen-created stashes
- View, sort, back up, restore, sanitize, and migrate the local SQLite database
- Deploy global and guild slash commands with one Deploy Commands button
- Start, stop, and restart Hachi through PM2
- Read PM2 status and recent logs

Global command updates can take time to appear in Discord. Guild commands are deployed only to the server matched by `guildId`, and usually appear much faster for testing.

## Command Details

### Setup Notifications

Use `/setup` to configure Discord channels and roles for stream notifications.

The setup command opens an ephemeral panel with buttons for:

- My Stream
- Affiliate Streams
- Submit

Changes made in the panel are pending until you press Submit. Selecting channels, selecting roles, or clearing settings updates the panel, but nothing is written to the database until Submit is pressed.

### Streamers

Use `/stream add` to add a streamer to the database:

```console
/stream add name: FearlessKenji discord: https://discord.gg/FearlessKenji
```

- `name` is the streamer login name, such as `fearlesskenji` from `https://www.twitch.tv/fearlesskenji`.
- `discord` is optional. Add it when the streamer has their own Discord server.

After running `/stream add`, Hachi opens an ephemeral panel with the streamer's pending settings:

- Discord: Provided or Not provided
- Twitch Notifications: Yes, No, or Not Set
- Kick Notifications: Yes, No, or Not Set
- Your Stream: Yes, No, or Not Set

Each selection updates the panel, but the streamer is not written to the database until Submit is pressed. If an option is still Not Set when Submit is pressed, the panel asks you to select every option before saving.

Use `/stream list` to check which streamers are configured, whether they are labeled as self or affiliate, and which notification types are enabled.

Use `/stream remove name: streamername` to remove a streamer from the database.

### Birthdays

Use `/birthday set` to store your birthday for the current server. Hachi accepts flexible month/day input:

```console
/birthday set date: 12/25
/birthday set date: December 25
```

Numeric birthday dates use American `MM/DD` order.

- `/birthday set` adds or updates your birthday.
- `/birthday view user: @member` shows a member's stored birthday.
- `/birthday list month: January` lists birthdays for a month. Month input accepts names, abbreviations, or numbers, and the command provides month autocomplete.
- `/birthday remove` removes your stored birthday from the current server.

Administrators can configure automatic birthday posts:

```console
/birthday setup channel: #birthdays week_role: @Staff day_role: @Birthday hour: 12pm timezone: America/New_York
```

- `channel` is where birthday reminders and birthday-day posts are sent.
- `week_role` is an optional role to ping one week before birthdays.
- `day_role` is an optional role to ping on birthday days.
- `hour` is a whole-hour local posting time such as `12pm`, `noon`, or `13`.
- `timezone` is the IANA timezone used for the server's birthday schedule.

Hachi posts one reminder seven days before a birthday and one birthday message on the day itself. February 29 birthdays are celebrated on February 28 during non-leap years.

### Profiles

Use `/profile set` to manage your per-server profile. You can set an avatar, banner, bio, or nickname for the current server.

Use `/profile clear` to remove one profile field, or clear the full profile. This command requires Manage Server permission.

### Reaction Roles

Use `/reaction roles add` to create a reaction-role panel. The setup flow asks for a target channel and title. You can optionally provide a message for the embed body; otherwise Hachi uses a default message. The command then opens a public editor where you can add assignable roles.

Reaction-role embeds use a fixed yellow color.

Converting existing messages requires the Message Content intent to be enabled for the bot in code and in the Discord Developer Portal.

The editor uses a searchable role selector for adding roles. The setup message is public so the admin who started it can react to the message to assign emojis to roles in order. Removing one of those reactions updates the preview and shifts the remaining emoji order. Custom emoji must belong to the server where the command is used.

When a panel needs multiple messages, continuation messages are created automatically and only show the role list.

Administrators can right-click an existing reaction-role panel and use `Edit Reaction Roles` to open the same setup editor with the current roles and emojis loaded.

Administrators can also use the `Convert to Reaction Roles` message context menu to parse an existing message into a bot-owned reaction-role embed. The converter keeps the leading message text, turns perceived category headings into embed fields, matches emoji lines to assignable server roles, supports common `:emoji_name:` shortcodes, and adds the matched reactions.

### Rules

Use `/rules` to post a custom rules embed. The command asks for a target channel and optional color and verification role, then opens a modal where you can enter the rules title and body.

```console
/rules channel:#rules color:green verification:@Member
```

The color option accepts common color names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, cyan, magenta, pink, black, white, and gray. It also accepts hex colors such as `#ff0000`, `ff0000`, `0xff0000`, and short hex values such as `#f00`.

If a verification role is selected, Hachi adds a second embed asking members to react with a check mark. Adding the reaction grants the selected role; removing the reaction removes it. Posting a new rules verification message replaces the previous verification mapping for that server.

## Updates and Local Changes

HachiGen checks for Git updates from the Updates page and also checks on startup.

If updates are available, the Check Updates button changes to Update. If local files have changed, HachiGen saves those changes to a recoverable Git stash before updating. The Updates page shows local changes, incoming commits, and any HachiGen-created stash. Restore Changes applies the saved stash without deleting it. Delete Changes permanently removes the saved stash.

Before applying updates, HachiGen also backs up local runtime files such as `.env`, `config/config.json`, and `database/database.sqlite` into `manager/backups/`.

## Database Maintenance

HachiGen's Database page can show read-only table data, sort columns by clicking table headers, create dated SQLite backups, restore a selected backup with confirmation, and review the current database for schema or data issues.

Sanitize validates the database schema, checks SQLite integrity, and shows a review popup before making changes. Any selected cleanup creates a safety backup first.

The Dashboard also shows database schema status. If Hachi finds a schema mismatch, the Database page enables Migrate. Safe migration creates a backup first and stops if destructive changes would be required. Force Migrate is intentionally red because it can drop extra columns while reshaping the database to the current Hachi schema.

Console database commands are available for troubleshooting:

```console
npm run db:audit
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:migrate:force
```

Migration backups are stored under `database/backups/migrations/`, and Hachi keeps the five newest automatic migration backups.

## Logs

HachiGen shows PM2 and HachiGen activity on the Logs page. The Clear PM2 and Clear HachiGen buttons only clear the visible log windows; they do not delete real logs.

Hachi writes runtime logs in the `logs/` folder. The `logs/` folder is ignored by Git.

## Troubleshooting

- If Discord global commands do not appear immediately, wait a while. Global command updates can take time to propagate.
- If guild commands do not appear, confirm `guildId` is the Discord server where you are testing and run Deploy Commands again.
- If HachiGen reports missing Node.js tooling, install Node.js 18.18.0 or newer. npm is included with Node.js and may be needed while HachiGen installs package dependencies.
- If an executable icon looks stale after a rebuild, close File Explorer windows pointed at the folder or restart Windows Explorer. Windows caches icon previews aggressively.
- If PM2 status looks stale, use Refresh in HachiGen and check the Logs page for command output.

## Developer Notes

### HachiGen Packaging

HachiGen is packaged with Electron Builder. The portable executable is created at `manager/dist/HachiGen.exe`, then copied to the repository root as `HachiGen.exe`.

To rebuild HachiGen and update the root executable, run:

```console
npm run build:hachigen
```

Icon inputs:

- Generated icon consumed by Electron Builder: `manager/icon.ico`
- Build configuration: `manager/package.json`

When changing the icon, generate a fresh `manager/icon.ico` from the desired source image, then package HachiGen again. The source image is not packaged with the repo. `manager/icon.ico` is tracked so future builds use the same icon; `manager/dist*/` is generated output and is ignored by Git.
